# Introduction
A queue in C is basically a linear data structure to store and manipulate the data elements. It follows the order of First In First Out (FIFO). In queues, the first element entered into the array is the first element to be removed from the array. A queue is open at both ends. One end is provided for the insertion of data and the other end for the deletion of data.
A real-world example of queue can be a single-lane one-way road, where the vehicle enters first, exits first. More real-world examples can be seen as queues at the ticket windows and bus-stops.
